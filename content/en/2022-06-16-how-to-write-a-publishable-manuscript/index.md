> My mentor gave our lab a presentation recently on how to write a publishable manuscript. He was elected into the National Academy of Sciences last month and has tons of publications. Therefore, I recorded some bullet points of his presentation and hope it will help when you are about to write your own manuscripts.



## Abstract/Summary

- The best of your paper
- Key findings and conclusions
- Significance of your findings
- Be sure that conclusion is supported by data
- Write after you finish your entire paper (can write first but need to revise the abstract at the end)


## Introduction

- Short overview on the topic

- Clearly identify the gap to be closed

- Rationale to perform the described work

- Very important (reviewers already made mind after reading introduction)

- Hypothesis is optional


## Materials and methods

- The easiest part of a paper 

- Clear and concise

- Cite appropriate references for methods

- Describe controls (important) and new methods (in fully detail if the methods are new, old methods can be cited)

- Statistical analysis and animal use guidelines, sequencing data upload to database

## Results

- Present in a clear and cohesive way: section by section

- Remember you are the story teller( give reasons)

- Draw conclusions and avoid lengthy discussion

- Bones and meat (backbone is the main findings/data, small findings are meat)

- Follow logical flow but not necessarily the timeline of the experiments


## Discussion

- Discuss your findings in the context of what have been known

- Compare and contrast
  1. identify the uniqueness of your findings
  2. avoid to repeat the result section

- Differentiate speculations vs. conclusions

- Alternative explanations

- Significance of your findings


## Reference

- Cite the right references; directly relevant to your work; avoid indirect citation if possible

- Don't randomly select; know who are the pioneers and major contributors in the field

## Excluding reviewers

- Feel free to use this right

- Editors will honor your choices

- Exclude only if you are sure

- Don't exclude if not sure ( your friends may not be the best reviewers, while not-so-friendly people may give you a fair and positive review)


## The review proces

- Two-tier process, screening by editors and then detailed review by experts familiar with your work(used by the most prestigious journals)

- Most journals will directly send your paper to individual reviewers

## Brutal to critiques
