# Eddy Jet 2W Spiral Plater

- EDDY JET 2W is a laboratory device used for spiral plating. It dispenses a precise amount of culture onto the agar plate in a controlled manner, producing a consistent and reproducible spiral pattern. This can save time and effort compared to manual plating techniques, and also reduces the risk of contamination.


## General description

- Components：
a: main unit, 
b: disposable micro-syringe
c: disposable sample beaker
d: holder for micro-syringe
e: holder for beakers box
f: holder for 10 beakers

## Traditional serial dilution method

- Dilute Samples into suitable dilutions

- Plate 100 ul of different dilutions on different agar plates 

- Ideally, plates containing 30-300 colonies per plate should be counted

## Introduction to spiral plating

- Spiral plating is a technique used in molecular biology to grow and culture bacterial or yeast colonies on agar plates in a spiraling pattern. This allows for more efficient use of space on the plate and also provides a visual representation of colony growth patterns

- Spiral plating is a two-in-one method: diluter and plater at the same time. The spiral plating method can save time and resources by cutting down on additional dilution and plating steps

- Spiral platers rotate an agar plate while pour decreasing amounts of liquid sample onto its surface describing an Archimedean spiral

- After incubating the plates, colonies appear distributed along the spiral’s track with a radial decrease in concentration. In this fashion, a single 90 mm Petri plate contains across its surface the equivalent to a threefold decimal dilution concentration range

## Operating procedures

1. Prepare serial dilutions from a sample culture.

2. Choose the appropriate dilutions according to your estimate of the original CFU of the sample culture.

3. Put around 700—900 ul of dilution into a new beaker.

4. Open the lid, place an agar plate, put the beaker in holder.

5. Select spread settings, automatic feeding, automatic identification.

6. Press the Green arrow to start.


## Counting 

- Can be counted manually with a specific counting grid

- Usually counted with automatic colony counter



# SphereFlash colony counter

## General description

- The SphereFlash® is an Automatic Colony Counter that meets all the requirements for modern microbiology laboratories.

- The optional Halos PRO app, the SphereFlash® unit can be transformed to measure inhibition halos accepting various circle approximation criteria to obtain the corresponding diameters of virtual circle areas.


## Workflow

- Put the Petri Dish in the centring device of SphereFlash

- Choose the method you want to apply according to your plate

- SphereFlash counts the colonies in a few seconds

- Obtain the report and print it in PDF


## Counting examples

- For example, counting Campylobacter, method: TEMPLATE_Sharp; inoculation mode: E_Mode_50ul; Dilution factor: 100,000; Plate Diameter(mm): 82.
