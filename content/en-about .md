I was born in Tonghua, a small city which is located in Jilin Province, Northeastern China. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in Veterinary Medicine from China Agricultural University in 2018. I had a memorable time in CAU and also got familiar with Beijing. Later, I got my Ph.D. degree in Veterinary Microbiology from Iowa State University (ISU). ISU locates in Ames, a really beautiful and peaceful town in Iowa. I have many hobbies and I will not name them one by one here. I was born to be adventurous. Here, I may mainly record my random thoughts, travel and reading notes.

**Hope I like it.**
