<div align='center' ><font size='18'>Autognosis</font></div>

I am Kimki, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Iowa State University, College of Veterinary Medicine.

I was born in Tonghua, a small city which is located in Jilin Province, northeast China.

I got my bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Medicine from China Agricultural University in 2013, I had a good time in CAU and also got familiar with Beijing because of my undergrad life.

I have many hobbies and I won’t name them one by one here.

I was born to be adventurous.

Here, I may mainly record my random thoughts,travel and reading notes.

Hope I like it.。
